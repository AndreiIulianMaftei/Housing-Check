The document you uploaded is the **“Paritätische Lebensdauertabelle”** (Paritary Life Expectancy Table), created jointly by the Swiss Homeowners’ Association and the Swiss Tenants’ Association. It’s a guideline for tenants, landlords, and property managers. Here’s the English translation of the key parts:

### Information Sheet for Tenants

**What it is:**
The “Paritary Life Expectancy Table” lists average life spans for construction elements, materials, appliances, and fittings typically used in rented apartments. It’s meant as a fair standard for both tenants and landlords.

**When it’s used:**

* To assess damages and defects, usually when a tenant moves out.
* To calculate rent adjustments for value-enhancing investments (e.g. renovations).

**Key points:**

* Life spans are based on normal use and average quality.
* Excessive wear and tear can reduce the life span.
* Prices listed are only guidelines (from 2005), not fixed amounts, and exclude transport, disposal, or luxury/budget items.
* “Small maintenance” (like replacing seals, light bulbs, or shower hoses) is the tenant’s responsibility.
* Tenants are not entitled to automatic replacements once a life span is over—only if something is defective.

**Examples:**

* If a carpet with a 10-year life span is ruined after 6 years, the tenant pays 40% of replacement costs.
* If a sink cracks after 12 years (life span 35 years), the tenant may owe only a small depreciation amount.
* If a carpet is older than its life span, no costs are charged to the tenant when it’s replaced.

**Special rules:**

* Life spans are reduced for heavy use (e.g. –20% in offices, –25% in shops, –50% in restaurants).
* Damp rooms without ventilation shorten the life of furniture, mirrors, joints, and paint.
* Minor damage like nail holes, scratches, or color changes behind furniture usually count as normal wear.
* Lost keys must be replaced at the tenant’s expense, but large rekeying costs only if misuse is likely.

**Insurance:**
Liability insurance usually covers damages that are not due to normal wear, gradual use, or improper handling. Notify the insurer early if a move-out inspection is coming.
